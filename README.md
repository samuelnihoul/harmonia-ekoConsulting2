#Harmonia-ekoConsulting2

harmonia-ekoConsulting2 is a Flutter Web app to showcase HE Consulting services. In this README, we'll explain how to run the app's development server on your machine, even if you don't have any technical experience.

##Prerequisites

Before you can run the app's development server, you'll need to make sure your machine meets the following requirements:

You have Flutter installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Flutter yet, please follow the Flutter installation instructions for your operating system.
You have a modern web browser installed (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
You have a stable internet connection
Running the Development Server
To run the app's development server, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt on your machine.
Navigate to the root directory of the app using the cd command.
Run the following command to start the development server:
`flutter run -d chrome`
After a few moments, your default web browser should open and display the app running on the development server. If the app doesn't open automatically, you can navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
If you make changes to the app's code, the development server should automatically reload the app in your web browser to reflect the changes.
That's it! You're now running the development server for your Flutter Web app. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to the app's developer for help.
